# VoxelPlus
Adds better voxels!

Adds sizes from 100 pixels to one MILLION pixels. It also adds in a variety of new printers that allow for the creation of ores, liquids, and meds!

I've removed the liquid pumps from 2.0, since they weren't really worth it. Especially because there are better mods for automation. So, I have decided to stick with the original idea of the mod, just expanding the mostly unexplored things called pixels.

Ever wanted to pay another player in pixels, but didn't have small or big enough sizes for a reasonable transaction? Worry no more, as I have created a mod that adds 100 to 1 million pixel sizes in voxels to allow for even BIGGER or SMALLER transactions! You can also print all the ores in the Basic and Advanced Ore Reconstitution Stations(which are made in the Pixel Station, which is made in the Iron Crafting Table) for 10x the number of pixels you get from refining the ores into pixels. (I will be adding cheaper ways to print the ores later, this is just the first one.)

I might add more features later, but I'm still relearning how to mod Starbound so don't expect anything super complicated. If you have some ideas though I'm more than happy to hear them! I'll bet I can create some of them.

Mod Versions:
- 2.0 to 2.1 are for 1.1.5+
- 1.9 to 1.0 are for Spirited Giraffe

Mod Features:
- [WIP]Adds a codex you can craft for free that you should start with that briefly explains how to use the mod.
- Adds several larger sizes for voxels, such as 20k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 500k, and 1m (1 million).
- Adds 3 smaller sizes, 100p (Pixels), 200p, and 500p.
- Adds the Pixel Station for crafting the mod's special crafting stations. (Iron crafting table)
- Adds the Basic Ore Reconstitution Station & Advanced Ore Reconstitution Station to allow for printing all ores, although for 10x the amount you get from refining the ores into pixels.
- Adds the Liquidation Reactor, which allows for printing of liquids.
- Adds the Med Assembler, which can be used to make Stimpaks, Medkits, and more.
- Is compatible with almost all mods. If it doesn't work with one you have, let me know and I'll try to fix it.

To-do List:
- Continue to add uses for voxels and pixels beyond just the printer and buying things.
- Possibly a machine that changes the weather for a large amount of pixels, although unlikely.
- Liquid voxels, because what screams wealth more than having a fountain of money?
- 1 and 10 pixel voxels. Not really sure what transaction would be that small, but I see no reason not to add them.
- Anything that the community suggests that is within my capabilities!

mysteek_80 drew the sprites for the Med Assembler, Basic, and Advanced Ore Stations, and did an amazing job of it. I highly encourage checking their stuff out here, if you are looking for more amazing mods and sprites!
